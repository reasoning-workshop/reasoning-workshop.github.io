The workshop on Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models (FoRLM) will take place during the weekend of <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);"><strong>December 6-7 (TBD) at NeurIPS 2025</strong></span> in San Diego, California.

Our workshop's goal is to <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);"><strong>advance foundational understanding, principled innovations, and rigorous scientific evaluations for reasoning in language models</strong></span>.
These advancements are built upon theoretical analyses and controlled empirical studies that illuminate how reasoning emerges, where it fails, and how it can be systematically improved.

We want to foster dialogue between communities with complementary strengths---those
building theoretical models of reasoning phenomena,
those designing experiments that reveal its emergence or failure in practice,
and those proposing algorithmic developments that advance reasoning---around <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);"><strong>three primary questions</strong></span>:

1.  How are language models able to solve complex tasks, and what do they still struggle with?
2.  What fundamental challenges stand in the way of advancing reasoning capabilities?
3.  What algorithmic innovations can overcome these obstacles?

**Submit:**
Please see our <a href="https://reasoning-workshop.github.io/cfp/">Call for papers</a> for details and author instructions. The deadline is on <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);"><strong>Wednesday, September 3, 2025</span></strong>.
<!-- We are inviting paper submissions to a single, non-archival track, with <span style="color: #ac0da2;">*deadline Wednesday, September 3, 2025*</span>. See <a href="https://reasoning-workshop.github.io/cfp/">Call for papers</a> for details. -->
