The workshop on Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models (FoRLM) will take place on **Saturday, December 6 at NeurIPS 2025** in San Diego, California.

Our workshop is centered on developing *foundational understanding* (theoretical analyses and controlled empirical studies that illuminate how reasoning emerges, where it fails, and how it can be systematically improved), *principled interventions*, and *rigorous scientific evaluations* for reasoning in language models.

We aim to foster dialogue between communities with complementary strengths---those building theoretical models of reasoning phenomena;
those designing experiments that reveal its emergence or failure in practice;
and those proposing algorithmic developments that advance reasoning---around three primary questions:

1.  How are LMs able to solve complex tasks, and why do they often struggle with seemingly simple ones?
2.  What fundamental challenges stand in the way of advancing reasoning capabilities?
3.  What algorithmic developments can overcome these obstacles?
