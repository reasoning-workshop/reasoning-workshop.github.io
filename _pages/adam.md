**Adam Block** is a postdoc at Microsoft Research NYC. In July 2025, he will join the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. Previously, he was a PhD student in the math department at MIT with affiliations in the Laboratory for Information & Decisions Systems and the Statistics and Data Science Center. His research focuses on bridging theory and practice within machine learning by designing efficient algorithms with provable guarantees under realistic assumptions on data, with a special focus on learning in sequential decision making tasks. His research was generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Before MIT, Adam completed a B.A in Mathematics at Columbia University, where he was an I.I. Rabi scholar.
