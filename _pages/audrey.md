**Audrey Huang** is a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science advised by Nan Jiang at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, she is excited about combining ideas from RL theory with the capabilities and structures of language modeling to design efficient and provable algorithms. She also works on the complexity of online/offline RL with function approximation, and imitation learning. Audrey has interned at Microsoft Research, Google, and Adobe, and received her MS from Carnegie Mellon University and BS from Caltech.
