We encourage submissions on XYZ in the form of 4-8 page papers (excluding references), which will be sumibtted on OpenReview.
Submissions published previous at archival venues or submitted to NeurIPS are not permitted.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. **Models for Reasoning**
    - Formal or conceptual frameworks that characterize reasoning phenomena

2. **Principled Algorithmic Interventions**
    - Design of algorithms grounded in theoretical and empirical insights

3. **Diagnostics and Evaluations**
    - Dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and scientific methods that isolate and probe reasoning behaviors

4. **Representational and Architectual Challenges**
    - How model architectures, internal representations, and generation methods enable or limit reasoning abilities

5. **Training Paradigms and the Emergence of Reasoning**
    - How pre-training, supervised finetuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time methods interact to elicit reasoning capabilities
