**Submission deadline:** Wednesday, September 3, 2025

**We welcome contributions that advance the scientific foundations of reasoning in language models**, such as by:
- Deeper conceptual understanding through scientific experimentation and theoretical analysis
- Developing formal frameworks that model reasoning
- Creating well-defined, interpretable testbeds for evaluating reasoning behavior
- Designing principled algorithmic interventions, and evaluating them rigorously

Submissions may have at most 9 content pages (less than is perfectly fine), excluding references and supplementary material.
We use OpenReview.
Papers that were submitted to NeurIPS, or that have been previously published in archival venues, are not permitted.


**Topics of interest include**, but are not limited to:

1. **Models for Reasoning**
    - Formal or conceptual frameworks that characterize reasoning phenomena

2. **Principled Algorithmic Interventions**
    - Design of algorithms grounded in theoretical and empirical insights

3. **Diagnostics and Evaluations**
    - Dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and scientific methods that isolate and probe reasoning behaviors

4. **Representational and Architectual Challenges**
    - How model architectures, internal representations, and generation methods enable or limit reasoning abilities

5. **Training Paradigms and the Emergence of Reasoning**
    - How pre-training, supervised finetuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time methods interact to elicit reasoning capabilities

### Important dates
(All dates are in 2025)

- Submission deadline: Wednesday, May 21st, 11:59 PM UTC
- Author notification: Monday, May 26th
- Workshop date: Monday, June 30th

### Dual submission policy

Since the workshop is non-archival, FoPt invites submissions that may be substantially similar to abstracts/papers that have previously been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to a peer-reviewed conference or journal. Submitted abstracts need not be anonymized.

## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and anonymization

Submitted abstracts are limited to one page, excluding references. Authors are permitted to submit papers which have already previously appeared in a conference, journal or workshop, or published to Arxiv. There is no formatting constraint for such submissions.

<!-- An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Appendices must be uploaded as a separate file. -->

<!-- All details, proofs and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, or possibly in the appendices. However, submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), and so enough details, including proof details, must be provided in the main text to convince the reviewers of the submissionsâ€™ merits. -->

**Anonymization:** Submissions should be suitable for single-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions are permitted to include author names and other identifying information. Reviewer names are withheld from the authors.

**Style files:** For submitted one-page abstracts, please use the COLT style file, linked below.

- [LaTeX style files and template](https://learningtheory.org/colt2025/COLT2025_style.zip)

For papers which have previously appeared at a conference/journal/workshop/Arxiv, there is no page limit or formatting constraint.

### Submitting your paper

Abstarcts should be submitted through OpenReview; the deadline for submissions is 5pm EST on Monday, May 19th, 2025.
