**Submission deadline:** Wednesday, September 3, 2025

**We welcome contributions that advance the scientific foundations of reasoning in language models**, such as by:
- Deeper conceptual understanding through scientific experimentation and theoretical analysis
- Developing formal frameworks that model reasoning
- Creating well-defined, interpretable testbeds for evaluating reasoning behavior
- Designing principled algorithmic interventions, and evaluating them rigorously

**Submission instructions TLDR:** Submissions may have at most 9 content pages (within that range, all lengths are welcome), excluding references and supplementary material.
Papers will be submitted to <a href="https://openreview.net/">(TBD) this OpenReview portal</a>.
Works that have been published at archival venues, including NeurIPS 2025, will be removed from consideration.


#### Topics of Interest

These include, but are not limited to:

1. **Models for Reasoning**
    - Formal or conceptual frameworks that characterize reasoning phenomena

2. **Principled Algorithmic Interventions**
    - Design of algorithms grounded in theoretical and empirical insights

3. **Diagnostics and Evaluations**
    - Dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and scientific methods that isolate and probe reasoning behaviors

4. **Representational and Architectual Challenges**
    - How model architectures, internal representations, and generation methods enable or limit reasoning abilities

5. **Training Paradigms and the Emergence of Reasoning**
    - How pre-training, supervised finetuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time methods interact to elicit reasoning capabilities

#### Important dates

- **Submission deadline:** Wednesday, September 3, 2025, AoE
- **Author notification:** Monday, September 22, 2025, AoE
- **Workshop date:** Saturday, December 6, 2025


#### Submission Instructions

**Format:** Submitted papers may have at most 9 content pages, excluding references and supplementary material.
Within those constraints, all page lengths are welcome.
Previously published papers, including those at NeurIPS 2025, will not be permitted (see "Dual Submission Policy" below).

**Style files:** Submissions must use the <a href="https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip"> NeurIPS 2025 style files </a>.

**Submitting your paper:** Please upload your submission as a single PDF to <a href="https://openreview.net/">(TBD) this OpenReview portal</a>. 

**Anonymization:** Reviews will be double-blind. Please ensure that submissions do not contain author names (should be handled automatically by the NeurIPS style files) or other identifying information.

#### Dual Submission Policy

Per the <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForWorkshopsGuidance">NeurIPS 2025 workshop guidances</a>,

> "workshops are not a venue for work that has been previously published in other conferences on machine learning or related fields. Work that is presented at the main NeurIPS conference should not appear in a workshop, including as part of an invited talk."

In accordance, any submission that will be presented at the main NeurIPS conference will be removed from consideration, ensuring that FoRLM 2025 best facilitates fresh contributions best suited to the workshop's format.
