**Pavel Izmailov** is a Researcher at Anthropic, and contributed to the recent Claude 3.7 coding and reasoning model. Starting in Fall 2025, he will be joining New York University as an Assistant Professor in the Tandon Computer Science and Engineering Department, and Courant Computer Science by courtesy. Previously he worked on reasoning and problem solving in language models at OpenAI. He contributed to the OpenAI o1 models, a new state-of-the-art in LLM reasoning, and also worked on weak-to-strong-generalization on the superalignment team under Jeff Wu, Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at NYU under the supervision of Andrew Gordon Wilson, and received an outstanding paper award at ICML 2022 for his work on Bayesian models and methods. Previously, he was an organizer of the Workshop on Trustworthy Multi-Modal Foundation Models and AI Agents (ICML 2024), Workshop on Reliable and Responsible Foundation Models (ICLR 2024), the AISTATS 2023 communications chair, and the lead student organizer of the NeurIPS 2021 competition "Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning."
