**Tatsunori Hashimoto** is an assistant professor at the computer science department in Stanford university. His research uses tools from statistics to make machine learning systems more robust and trustworthy â€” especially in complex systems such as large language models. The goal of his research is to use robustness and worst-case performance as a lens to understand and make progress on several fundamental challenges in machine learning and natural language processing. A few topics of recent interest are long-tail behavior, developing systemic understanding, and fairness. Previously, he was a post-doc at Stanford working for John C. Duchi and Percy Liang on tradeoffs between the average and worst-case performance of machine learning models. Before that, he was a graduate student at MIT co-advised by Tommi Jaakkola and David Gifford and a undergraduate student at Harvard in statistics and math advised by Edoardo Airoldi.
